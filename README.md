# WebAssembly/JavaScript Interface for MathCAT

MathCAT is a library that supports conversion of MathML to speech and braille among other things.

This project is a rough stab at adding a WebAssembly/JavaScript interface to MathCAT.
Visit [the MathCAT project page](https://nsoiffer.github.io/MathCAT/) for more info or if you want to play around with MathCAT's capabilities, [try out the demo](https://nsoiffer.github.io/MathCATDemo/).
